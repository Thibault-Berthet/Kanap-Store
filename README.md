Hi,

This is the fourth project that i did as part of my training to become web developer. The project was about learning and using JavaScript.

To launch the project you will need to have Node and npm installed locally on your machine.
Then clone the repo and from the "back" folder of the project run "npm install".
All the "node_modules" necessary will be installed.
After that, run "node server" and the server should start on "localhost" with default port "3000".
If the server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the console when the server starts :
"Listening on port 3001"

If you watch it, first of all thank you ! And feel free to contact me about some part of the code ;)

I wish you a nice day or evening,

Thibault
