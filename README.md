Hi,

This is the fourth project that i did as part of my training to become web developer. The project was about learning and using JavaScript.

If you watch it, first of all thank you ! And feel free to contact me about some part of the code ;)

I wish you a nice day or evening,

Thibault



### Back end Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Back end Installation ###

Clone this repo. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`.
You can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`.
If the server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
